# About Me

I am a senior in high school and want to major in Computer Science in college! I plan to use my coding skills in the themed entertainment industry working on rollercoasters as an Imagineer.

Skills:
- Java (4 years)
- Python (1 year)
- C# (1 year)
- Object Oriented Programming
- Algorithms (Sorting, Searching, Recursive, Hashing)
- Data Structures (Arrays, Lists, Stacks, Queues, Trees, Graphs)
- System Design
- Software Development Lifecycle
- Google Sheets

Past Projects / Accomplishments:
- Coded Mario in Java for my end of year project. (Freshman Year)
- Made a 5 on the AP Computer Science A Exam. (Sophomore Year)
- Worked with a team of 3 to create a multi-level video game with bosses and mini games for our end of year project. Had to present our game concept (including a screen flow diagram, all the classes, objects, and methods we intended to use, concept art, and more), follow a strict timeline we made for ourselves with weekly goals, and present the finished product by a deadline. (Junior Year)

Current Projects:
- Working with a team to build an app which makes it easier for students at my highschool to connect with other students for tutoring. Students will fill out a google form in order to submit a request for tutoring. The app will then take that request and turn it into a ticket which students who signed up to tutor can view on the app. Tutors can claim these tickets (which will then appear as claimed to other tutors accessing the app) and message the students from there to confirm a tutoring time. When the tutoring session is complete, tutors can mark it as done and the ticket will dissapear.
- Studying for the OCA (Oracle Certified Associate) certification.
